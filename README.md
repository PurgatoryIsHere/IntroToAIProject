# Intro-To-AI-Project

**Group**: Christopher Brice, Gabe Sanders, Evan Archer, Marvin Wocheslander

## Project Description

Using machine learning to predict stock prices of JP Morgan Chase (JPM). The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict stock prices of JPM based on historical stock data.

We tested a wide range of machine learning models to find the best model for this task. We used the following models:

* Linear Regression - `Model4.py`
* Decision Tree Regressor - `Model2.py`
* LSTM - `Model1.ipynb`
* GRU - `Model3.ipynb`
